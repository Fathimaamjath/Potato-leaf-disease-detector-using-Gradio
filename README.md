POTATO LEAF DISEASE DETECTOR 

PROBLEM STATEMENT: To develop a model for detecting diseases affecting potato plant and implementing a simple user interface to examine the detector.

PROJECT EXPLANATION: Using this model we are detecting healthy plant leaves and two diseases affected leaves of potato plants.

1.Early blight  disease - Spots begin as small, dark, dry, papery flecks, which grow to become brown-black, circular-to-oval areas. 

2. Late Blight disease- Leaf spots begin as small, pale to dark green,   irregularly shaped spots.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION: 
 
  Step 1: Import necessary libraries/Modules
  
  Step 2: Loading the dataset 
  
  Step 3: Dataset visualization
  
  Step 4: Data preprocessing
  
  Step 5: Model Training
  
  Step 6: Implementing a simple user interface

MODULES EXPLANATION:

  [1] TensorFlow - libraries for building and training machine learning and deep learning models. 

  [2] Models and layers  module from TensorFlow keras API â€“ 
These modules allow to create, customize and train various neural network architecture for ML and DL task. 

  [3] Matplotlib is a popular and versatile Python library for creating interactive visualizations in many fields. It provides a wide range of tools for creating high-quality plots, charts, and figures.

  [4] Gradio is an open-source Python library used for creating interactive and customizable machine learning interfaces. It is used to build web-based interfaces for machine learning models and  making it easier for users to interact and understand the models.
